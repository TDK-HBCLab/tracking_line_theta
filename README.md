# tracking_line_theta
I use two roi image to find contour. The image was converted to gray image, so it's purpose that want to find out the black line or object. Two roi image center will connect to become a line, it is used to quadcopter to go forward and turn its yaw. 

you want to compile this code and execute, you can following step:
$cd ~/your_workspace/
$git clone this package web URL
$make
$./image
